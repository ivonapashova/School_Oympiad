# School_Oympiad
This is my project for the soon coming IT school olympiad.

My idea is to create a learning web app,which helps students see simple hardware building through software. My coding skills aren't as good to make the design so great but I'll try my best.

The practice page represents a few elements,which you can work with. The main jobs are desoldering and soldering. When you run the code you will firstly see the circuit board. Right next to it there will be 3 things - a resistor,a capacitor and a light-emitting diode. You will also see 2 buttons - "desoldering" and "soldering". When you click the soldering button you will have a soldering iron as your mouse pointer, then you will be able to move around the elements and put them on the circuit board.
